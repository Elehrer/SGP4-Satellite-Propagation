# SGP4-Satellite-Propagation
Analysis and Propagation of Satellites using their TLEs and SGP4 to find DOP of constellations

SGP4 and NumPy are required for these programs

The goal of this project is:
1. Generate ENU and XYZ coordinate files for a satelite over a period of its movement by using its TLEs with SGP4.
2. Create dilution of precision matrices using the aforementioned ENU data.
